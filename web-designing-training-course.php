                                        <p>Want to learn more about designing the best website with interactable features and an engaging interface? If yes, wait no longer and enroll yourself for our <b>Web Design Course in Ahmedabad &Indore</b> for detailed learning from academic experts.</p>
                                        
                                        <h5 class="h5 mt-40">Web designing course highlights</h5>
                                        <p>All the websites you see can be segregated into major parts, namely frontend and backend. The backend acts as the core engine, running all the internal processes, executing the APIs, and interacting with the data storage and business layers. However, it is the front end that gets exposed to the outer world and requires more attention. In recent times, the demand for skilled and expert web developers has skyrocketed by a whopping value. That’s because no matter how well-developed the backend engine layer is if the frontend doesn’t have the appeal or engagement factor, it won’t drive traffic to the business. Web designing is not just about choosing the colors for the user interface or designing the brand logo. Rather, it’s developing the entire front end using a varied technology stack, starting from CSS and HTML to programming languages like PHP and React. </p>

                                        <h5 class="h5 mt-40">What is website design?</h5>
                                        <p>In textbook terms, website design comprises planning, designing, organizing, and implementing the visual appearance, page layout, and on-page multimedia and graphical content. It makes the website available to the external world and ensures the visuals are appealing enough to keep the end users engaged for a long time. Whether it’s forming the wireframe using an HTML template or assigning colors and other elements through CSS styling, web designers are responsible for the functionality and visual appeal of the entire front end platform. Without website design, it won’t be possible to launch the website even if the backend layers are stable and functional.</p>
                                        <p>Our <b>web design training course</b> teaches students about the process's technical aspects, including JavaScript coding, HTML and CSS styling, layout designing through wireframes, and developing service-based APIs for interaction with the backend layers.</p>
