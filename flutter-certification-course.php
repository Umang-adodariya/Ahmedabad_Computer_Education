                                        <h5 class="h5 mt-40">Course highlights</h5>
                                        <p>In recent times, several cross-platform frameworks have been introduced to the world of developers, amongst which Flutter has proven to keep raising the standards beyond our imagination. Based on Google’s personal programming language, Dart, it allows the developer’s community to build fast-performing and engaging applications with top-notch features. Since it is a cross-platform framework, developers can build mobile applications for multiple platforms, including iOS and Android using a single codebase. In other words, you will need to work on a single code version without worrying about the platform’s native configurations or making any drastic changes in the code to deploy a certain feature.</p>
                                        <p>Owing to the growing popularity of this open-source framework, Ahmedabad Computer Education has curated a comprehensive <b>mobile app development course</b> using Flutter. From helping you master the art of using widgets to design the UI to understand APIs and parsing functions, we will give you detailed knowledge about the major features of this framework. With us, you can rest assured that your programming skills in Dart and knowledge regarding Flutter will improve significantly by leaps and bounds for better placement opportunities. All in all, we promise to help you build a prospective career as a mobile app developer or a skilled Flutter app developer in today’s competitive market.</p>

                                        <h5 class="h5 mt-40">What is Flutter and why you should learn the framework?</h5>
                                        <p>Launched in 2017, Flutter is an open-source framework running on Google’s Dart language. It allows developers to build mobile applications for multiple platforms using a single codebase, which practically eliminates additional efforts and time consumption from the developer’s end. Flutter’s key feature is the versatile widget library that can be further used to develop interactive components for the user interface. Thanks to the customization features, the widgets can be designed to fit the business needs and match the preferences of the target audience. With a strong and loaded ecosystem of libraries, APIs, and packages, you will be able to extend the functionalities of the developed application and even integrate the same with database and other system applications.</p>
                                        <p>Being the best <b>Flutter training institute</b>, we assure you a professional course like the one we offer will help you build a strong career. Some of the major reasons for learning the Flutter framework along with the Dart programming language are:</p>
                                        <div class="checklist mt-40">
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Since Flutter is based on Google’s programming language, Dart, it is already a proven platform that can be further used to develop hybrid mobile applications.</li>
                                                <li>With detailed knowledge about Flutter, you can develop mobile applications configurable for both iOS and Android platforms. Besides, you won’t even have to work on different code versions, specific to singular OS platforms.</li>
                                                <li>Flutter offers the opportunity to develop interactive and engaging user interfaces that will draw users’ attention through enhanced functionality and a profound visual appeal.</li>
                                                <li>Thanks to the hot reload feature, Flutter allows you to deploy instant changes to the application without taking it down from the server and making it unavailable to the users.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </div>

                                        <h5 class="h5 mt-40">What are the key features of Flutter that you should learn?</h5>
                                        <p>While several cross-platform development frameworks are available for the dev community, Flutter has proven to be superior due to a myriad of reasons. As a <b>Flutter training institute in Ahmedabad</b>, we encourage students to at least know about the salient features of this open-source network before enrolling themselves in our training program. This way, they can make a well-informed decision regarding their career growth and future goals and objectives.</p>
                                        <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Support for a single codebase</h6>
                                        <p>In Flutter, you will have to work with a single codebase even if the application to be developed is scheduled to be deployed across multiple operating systems, like iOS and Android. The framework’s internal engine will wrap the codes according to the native configurations for higher compatibility and an omnichannel user experience. This can reduce your efforts and the overall time dedicated to completing the software development life cycle.</p>
                                        <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Access to pre-build widgets</h6>
                                        <p>Flutter comes with a versatile collection of different widgets that can be further customized to create an engaging and appealing user interface for mobile applications. You will have access to Cupertino for developing custom widgets for iOS and Material Design for Android platforms. Owing to this, achieving a native feel of the user interface won’t require any additional effort from your end. Also, here, you will just have to declare the UI components to be added to the application and the rendering will be handled by the framework’s internal engine.</p>
                                        <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Promises for high performance</h6>
                                        <p>One of the many reasons to invest in our <b>Flutter certification course</b> is to gain the ability to develop high-performing mobile applications. Since the framework compiles code directly to native ARM code using the Dart programming language, you won’t have to rely on JavaScript or web views to extend the native feel to the application. Apart from this, the Skia graphics engine will directly render the pixels on the screen so that the application can run smoothly and deliver a high performance in every state.</p>
                                        <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Hot reload</h6>
                                        <p>Whenever you have to see the changes directly in the production environment, you would need to take down the application from the server so that the changes can be rendered properly. However, with Flutter, this hassle can be easily eliminated. The framework comes with the hot reload feature that renders the changes instantly in the live environment, allowing you to see the impact of your code changes without requiring any additional downtime. It will also help in faster debugging and rapid iteration for a faster software development lifecycle.</p>
                                        <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Dart programming language</h6>
                                        <p>Flutter is designed on Dart that support both asynchronous and object-oriented programming practices so that it would become easier to handle events, user interface components, and different types of networking tasks. Apart from this, the programming language amalgamates the goodness of JIT (Just-In-Time) for hot reload and AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) for code optimization so that the application can excel in terms of flexibility and performance.</p>
                                        <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Access to plugins and libraries</h6>
                                        <p>Another key feature of Flutter that makes it a leading open-source framework for cross-platform development is the huge ecosystem of libraries and plugins. You can use these packages and elements to access the device’s native features like sensors, cameras, GPS, and many more. Hence, you won’t have to develop APIs from scratch to extend the functionalities of the application and make it more compatible with the native engine of different devices.</p>

                                        <h5 class="h5 mt-40">What are the best job roles you can get with our Flutter course certification?</h5>
