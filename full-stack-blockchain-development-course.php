                                        <p>If you are planning for an advanced career portfolio with a strong technical foothold, opting for our blockchain certification course will be the most rational decision. Although blockchain was primarily introduced to record transactions and store details about cryptocurrencies, it has now found extensive use across multiple industries. The unique features of blockchain, especially its decentralized performance, make it suitable for several purposes that otherwise couldn’t be achieved by a conventional database system.</p>
                                        <p>Our blockchain course for beginners comprises topics related to blockchain development, studying the existing blockchains, decentralization, security, and immutability of data, and the underlying technical infrastructure. Additionally, we also provide sessions on advanced topics like data mining, layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains, and many more, so that students can gain comprehensive knowledge about the same. At Ahmedabad Computer Education, we aim to make our students future-ready so that they can begin their careers as proficient and skilled blockchain developers. </p>
                                        <h5 class="h5 mt-40">What is blockchain and why is it used?</h5>
                                        <p>The use of blockchain technology became more prominent in 2009 when Bitcoin was introduced to the market as the first cryptocurrency. In textbook terms, it is a shared database where information of different types is stored but in the form of blocks linked together with cryptographic programs. There is no central authority controlling the blockchain and its operations. On the contrary, the authority is distributed amongst multiple systems on the blockchain network, known as nodes. </p>
                                        <p>They authenticate every data to be stored on the blockchain ledger, access the stored records, and perform all other functions. One of the major differences between blockchain and any other conventional shared database is that the information stored on the former is immutable, meaning it cannot be modified further once added to the ledger in the form of blocks. Strong cryptographic scripts are deployed to the network to protect the data and make them immutable.</p>
                                        <p>While blockchain can be used for multiple uses, the most common application is as a transaction ledger. Our blockchain training in Indore will help students understand the practical applications of this decentralized shared database in different industries. For instance, it is often used in the finance industry to record transactions involving multiple users in a decentralized network. Similarly, it can be used in the supply chain industry to store records of products, straight from their point of origin to the final dispatch point.</p>
                                        <h5 class="h5 mt-40">What are the key features of blockchain that students learn?</h5>
                                        <p>Our blockchain course in Ahmedabad is curated in a way that students can learn the primary features of this shared database with ease. It will not only help them to master the technology but also work on real-time projects with ease. Below are some of the major features that we discuss in our classes for blockchain training.</p>
                                        <div class="checklist mb-1">
                                            <ul class="course-acc-ul">
                                                <li class="course-acc-li">Decentralization: Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology, meaning its control or authority is distributed amongst multiple users and not with a single entity. Hence, everyone must agree to any change in the state of data or the addition of a new block of data to the existing ledger.</li>
                                                <li class="course-acc-li">Immutability: Once data is mined and added to the blockchain ledger, it becomes immutable. Our experts will further explain the use of cryptographic algorithms to make data blocks immutable and prevent any further modification of the same.</li>
                                                <li class="course-acc-li">Enhanced security: In our blockchain course for beginners, we include lectures and an in-depth understanding of the security and encryption protocols associated with this decentralized ledger. Additionally, we also shed light on different consensus protocols adopted for working on the ledger, like Proof of Stakes and Proof of Work. </li>
                                                <li class="course-acc-li">4.Smart contract development and deployment: With us, students can learn the development of automated execution programs known as smart contracts that are deployed on the blockchain. These are sets of rules and conditions to automatically trigger an operation on the blockchain, like the completion of a monetary transfer or updating the records of a product in the supply chain ledger. </li>
                                                <li class="course-acc-li">Data mining: Our experts will also help students understand the concepts associated with data mining since it is required to develop a blockchain and add the data blocks to the existing ledger. For this, we will provide live training sessions on hashing, cryptographic encryption, and other computational logic relevant to data mining. </li>
