                                    <p>Out of the emerging technologies in today’s time, DevOps is one such concept that has revolutionized the entire software development lifecycle across the global IT industry. Bringing together the development and operational branches, it has played a significant role in streamlining the build, testing, and deployment phases. From process automation to easier code version management, DevOps paves the way for innovation and agility in IT projects. The entire delivery process is improvised through DevOps principles, ensuring minimal human errors and elimination of pain points created through manual delivery cycles.</p>

                                    <h5 class="h5 mt-40">What are the most important DevOps practices?</h5>
                                    <p>If you have planned to begin your career as a DevOps professional, the first thing to know is the industry-best practices related to this principle. You can consider these practices to be the foundation for implementing DevOps in any project or real-time scenario.</p>
                                    <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Continuous Integration</h6>
                                    <p>It focuses on merging codes pushed into the GIT branch from different systems or servers into a single codebase, which is then uploaded in the central repository. With frequent code integration and merge cycles, compilation issues and merge conflicts can be eliminated, which will again help in system stabilization. This is achieved through an automated build process where the code build starts on the scheduled time through different jobs and merges the code versions.</p>
                                    <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment</h6>
                                    <p>Once the code versions are integrated, the continuous delivery and continuous deployment concepts come into the picture. These automate the entire process of deploying the merged code version to the production environment without any manual intervention. It plays a crucial role in the agile project model where production releases need to be done frequently and with minimal server downtime.</p>
                                    <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Infrastructure-as-Code (IAC)</h6>
                                    <p>Under Infrastructure-as-Code practice, the infrastructure elements are version-controlled and managed through dev scripts and configuration files rather than manual control. It eliminates any drift in environment and infrastructure configurations, ensuring the environments remain up and running throughout the dev, build, and testing cycles.</p>
                                    <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Automated testing</h6>
                                    <p>Another most important principle of DevOps that you will learn through our DevOps certification course is automation testing. Here, the codes released into the server after the build process are automatically tested and validated against the expectations. Hence, the time needed to find the loopholes gets reduced significantly and the issues can be fixed on time before the final production release.</p>
                                    <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Version control</h6>
                                    <p>Also, our top DevOps courses Indore and Ahmedabad will help you learn the concepts related to version control since it allows the dev team to properly manage the codes without worrying about merge conflicts and integration errors. The DevOps team uses version control methodologies to track and monitor code changes, infrastructure modifications, and configuration files for better collaboration and merge control.</p>
                                    <h6 class="h6 mt-40">Containerization and orchestration</h6>
                                    <p>In DevOps, containerization is the practice of packaging applications and their dependencies like libraries, frameworks, and tools into a single, portable, and lightweight environment, known as the container. Multiple containers are created, which are then managed in a collaborative manner through the orchestration process.</p>
                                    <h5 class="h5 mt-40">Why DevOps is considered as a cutting-edge technological principle?</h5>
                                    <p>Integrating DevOps approaches and principles in any IT project can open a sea of opportunities, which otherwise would be out of reach when compared with traditional delivery and operational practices. So, before you enroll yourself in our DevOps certification course, knowing about its real-time benefits will answer several questions and understand its increasing market demand better.</p>
                                    <div class="checklist mt-40">
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b>Faster time to market:</b> Since DevOps automates the dev, build, and testing phases, new features and patches can be prepared within a very short time. additionally, integrating CI/CD pipelines will ensure these new changes get deployed to the production through automated routines, thereby reducing the time to market significantly.</li>
                                            <li><b>Improved collaboration:</b> With DevOps, it will become easier for the development and IT operations teams to coordinate tasks, share responsibilities, and eliminate communication siloes. As a result, the overall project efficiency and productivity will improve by leaps and bounds in no time.</li>
                                            <li><b>Higher system reliability:</b> One of the major benefits of implementing DevOps principles is the considerable increase in system stability and reliability. Test cycles will get automated, which will further ensure the bugs get fixed on time before the final production release. It will also reduce server downtime and make the environments available for a longer time through containerization and orchestration.</li>
                                            <li><b>Enhanced security:</b> DevOps can be combined with top-notch security practices, known as DevSecOps so that the security vulnerabilities get detected on time through CI/CD pipelines. Hence, professionals can easily address these issues and ensure the system becomes immune to sudden security breaches and cyberattacks.</li>
                                            <li><b>Scalability and flexibility:</b> Another benefit of integrating DevOps principles like containerization and orchestration is increased system and infrastructure scalability. In other words, these principles will allow professionals to change system configurations or modify resource utilization to sustain peak server traffic without system outage.</li>
                                        </ul>
